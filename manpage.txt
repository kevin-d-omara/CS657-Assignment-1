NAME
    Assignment1 - Watch a rover guide itself across an unknown exo-planet.

SYNOPSIS
    Assignment1 [environment-filename] [output-filename] [OPTIONS]...

DESCRIPTION
    Reads an environment map from 'environment-filename'.
    
    Environment File Format:
    The map file may have any name (i.e. MyMap.txt, MyMap.dat, MyMap, etc.).
    
    The contents must be a rectangular array of letters and/or numbers.
    
    Specify elements of the map with the following glyphs:
        Floor  -> '.' or '1'
        Wall   -> 'X' or '0'
        Pit    -> 'O' or '2' or '-'
		Shroud -> 'S' or '3'
        Start  -> 'R' or '8'
        Goal -  > 'G' or '9'
        
    Both the start position ('R'/'8') and the goal position ('G'/'9') may be
    omitted. In this case, the start position will be [6,6] and the goal
    position will be [width, height].

    Example Map File:
    R.X..O      810112      R.X..O
    ...X.X  or  111010  or  11.0.X
    XO.X..      021011      X2.X..
    .S...G      131119      .03..9
    
    If no filename is specified, an environment is created through user input.
    The user is offered two options: default and manual.
    
    Default:
        width  = 30
        height = 30
        start  = [6,6]
        goal   = [30,30]
        obstacle density = 50%
        obstacle types   = wall
        
    Manual:
        width  = ?
        height = ?
        start  = [?,?]
        goal   = [?,?]
        obstacle density = ?
        obstacle types = [wall, pit, shroud]
    
    Computes the path a Rover takes from some starting position to a goal
    position.
    
    Results are written to the filename specified ('output-filename'). If no
    filename is specified, results are written to 'results.txt' in the current
    directory.

OPTIONS
    The following options are supported:
    
	-a, --automatic		simulation continues without waiting for keypress
						note: this option has no effect if not used with -d

	-c, --concise		output only GoalReached/NoPathFound/MoveLimitReached,
						total moves, observed density, actual density

    -d, --display		prints each step of progress to the command line
						press any key to advance after each simulation step
    
    -f, --final			prints the contents of the output file to the screen at 
						the end of the simluation
                       
    -h, --help			display this menu

    -m, --man			display this menu
    
    -n, --no-map		supress command line output of the map (note: only works
						when used alongside -d or --display
                       
    -u, --unlimited		allows for unlimited move limit

EXAMPLES
    Assignment1 mymap1.txt
        Reads 'mymap1.txt' to create the environment, then outputs the
        simulation results to 'results.txt' in the working directory.
        
    Assignment1 mymap.map simulation_results.dat
        Reads 'mymap.map' to create the environment, then outputs the
        simulation results to 'simulation_results.dat' in the working directory.
        
    Assignment1
        User chooses between Default and Manual for environment creation.
        Results are output to 'results.txt' as default.
        
    Assignment1 -h
        Displays this information.
        
    Assignment1 -d
        The simulation is displayed to the terminal at each step. After each
		step, the simulation pauses until the user presses ANY key.

    Assignment1 -d -a
		The simulation is displayed to the terminal at each step. The simulation
		continues without waiting for user input.
        
    Assignment1 -f
        After the simulation is complete, the results are written to the screen.
        Note: these are the same contents as what is printed to 'results.txt'.
        
    Assignment1 -d -n
		The simulation is displayed to the terminal at each step, but the map is
        not shown. Instead, just the Rover's position, facing, and action are
        presented.
        
    Assignment1 -u
        The simulation is run with an unlimited (999,999) number of moves for
		the Rover.
        
BUGS
    The A*+ heuristics of Manhattan Distance and Chebyshev Distance are known to
    occasionally get "stuck". In this case, the rover toggles repeatedly
    between two actions until the move limit is reached. For this reason, these
    heuristics have been disabled.
